issueNumber: MDL-81096
notes:
  core_group:
    - message: >-
        - The `core_course/actionbar/group/init()` now receives an optional parameter, `extraParams`,
        to ensure all other parameters in the URL are maintained after the user changes the group.
        - Add the `core_group\external\get_groups_for_selector_test()` unit test class to ensure that
        the get_groups_for_selector() method works correctly.

  core:
    - message: >-
        - The `core\output\name_filter_bar` renderer class has been created to replace `core_grades::initials_selector`  to ensure

      type: improved
  core_grades:
    - message: >-
        - The `core_grades\general_action_bar` will now use the template `core/navigation_action_bar`
        instead of `core_grades/general_action_bar`.
  mod_quiz:
    - message: >-
        - The `mod_quiz\output\action_selector` has been created to take responsibility for rendering the action selector,
        (a component of the quiz navigation bar), enabling users to switch between quiz reports.
