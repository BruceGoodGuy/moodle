issueNumber: MDL-81096
notes:
  core_group:
    - message: >-
        - The `core_course/actionbar/group/init()` now receives an optional parameter, `extraParams`,
        to ensure all other parameters in the URL are maintained after the user changes the group.
        - Add the `core_group\external\get_groups_for_selector_test()` unit test class to ensure that
        the get_groups_for_selector() method works correctly.

  core:
    - message: >-
        - The `core\output\name_filter_bar` renderer class has been created to replace `core_grades::initials_selector`  to ensure
        it is available for use in other components.
        - The get_users_search_sql() method will now accept two additional parameters: $allowcustom and $custommappings.
          - When $allowcustom is true, it enables searching for users by their custom profile fields.
          - In cases $allowcustom is true, we should use the $custommappings fields to maintain the same alias in the query.

  core_grades:
    - message: >-
        - The `core_grades\general_action_bar` will now use the template `core/navigation_action_bar`
        instead of `core_grades/general_action_bar`.
  mod_quiz:
    - message: >-
        - The `mod_quiz\output\action_selector` has been created to take responsibility for rendering the action selector,
        (a component of the quiz navigation bar), enabling users to switch between quiz reports.
        - The service `mod_quiz\get_users_in_report` has been created to handle user search actions in the quiz report.
        - Add the `mod_quiz\external\get_users_in_report_test()` unit test class to ensure that the
          get_users_in_report_test() method works correctly.
