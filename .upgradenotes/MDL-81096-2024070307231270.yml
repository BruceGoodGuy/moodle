issueNumber: MDL-81096
notes:
  core_group:
    - message: >-
        - The `core_course/actionbar/group/init()` now receives an optional parameter, `extraParams`,
        to ensure all other parameters in the URL are maintained after the user changes the group.
        - Add the `core_group\external\get_groups_for_selector_test()` unit test class to ensure that
        the get_groups_for_selector() method works correctly.

  core:
    - message: >-
        - The `core\output\name_filter_bar` renderer class has been created to replace `core_grades::initials_selector`  to ensure
        it is available for use in other components.
        - The get_users_search_sql() method will now accept two additional parameters: $allowcustom and $custommappings.
          - When $allowcustom is true, it enables searching for users by their custom profile fields.
          - In cases $allowcustom is true, we should use the $custommappings fields to maintain the same alias in the query.

  core_grades:
    - message: >-
        - The `core_grades\general_action_bar` will now use the template `core/navigation_action_bar`
        instead of `core_grades/general_action_bar`.
        - The `core_grades::print_grade_page_head` method will now use the `render()` method to render the action bar
        instead of the `render_action_bar()` method.
        - The `core_grades::initials_selector` method has been deprecated; use `\core\output\name_filter_bar` instead.
        - The `core_grades/searchwidget/initials` file has been relocated to `core/searchwidget/initials` to ensure
        it is available for use in other components.
  mod_quiz:
    - message: >-
        - The `mod_quiz\output\action_selector` has been created to take responsibility for rendering the action selector,
        (a component of the quiz navigation bar), enabling users to switch between quiz reports.
        - The service `mod_quiz\get_users_in_report` has been created to handle user search actions in the quiz report.
        - Add the `mod_quiz\external\get_users_in_report_test()` unit test class to ensure that the
          get_users_in_report_test() method works correctly.
        - The `mod_quiz\attempts_report_options` has a new method `setup_from_params_array` to set necessary dat to the $option object.
        - The `mod_quiz\local\reports::report_base` class has been added several methods:
            - The method `print_action_bar` will be responsible for rendering the entire quiz navigation bar in the report.
            - The method `setup_report_data` allows retrieval of necessary data for the report, such as option objects and table objects.
            - The method `has_permission` checks whether the user has permission to access this report.

        - The `gradereport_grader::action_bar` class now uses the template `core/action_bar`
